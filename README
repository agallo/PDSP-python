This script is designed to control a PDSP (or HDSP) type display using Python
when connected to a Raspberry Pi.

Things to do:
    * Add in necessary code to send output to GPIO
    (need to determine if using RPi.GPIO or wiringPi)
    * more flexible input (currently, using statically defined variable)
